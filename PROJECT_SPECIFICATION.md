   Secure storage and retrieval of documents associated with references (e.g., screenshots, completion certificates).
   Advanced search and filtering capabilities to easily locate relevant references.
   1.3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
   RMS: Reference Management System

   Documents: Stores metadata about uploaded files (path, type, size) linked to References.
   (Potentially) Clients: Managed list of client names.
   (Potentially) Countries: Managed list of countries.
   (Potentially) Technologies: Managed list of technologies.
   Relationships:
   One User (Responsible) can be associated with many References.
   One Reference can have many Technologies.
   One Reference can have many Screenshots.
   One Reference can have one Completion Certificate.
   One Reference can have many Other Relevant Documents.
   One Client can be associated with many References.
   One Country can be associated with many References.
   All primary entities (References, Users, and potentially Clients, Countries, Technologies if implemented as such) will have full CRUD capabilities accessible according to user roles.
7. Assumptions, Dependencies, and Technical Stack
   7.1. Assumptions and Dependencies
   The company has the necessary infrastructure (server, database) to host the RMS, or will use a cloud-based solution.
   Users will have access to modern web browsers.
   Initial data migration from any existing systems (if applicable) is a separate project/phase.
   The definition of "priority" for references will be established and communicated internally.
   7.2. Technical Stack
   The proposed technical stack for the development of the Reference Management System is as follows:
   Frontend Framework: Next.js (with Pages Router)
   Authentication: NextAuth.js
   Styling: Tailwind CSS
   UI Components: Shadcn/ui
   Database: MongoDB
   Data Fetching/State Management (Client): React Query
   Form Management: React Hook Form
   Schema Validation: Zod
   API Layer/Type Safety: tRPC
   Global State Management (Client): Zustand
   File Uploads (Server-side parsing): Formidable
8. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for V1)
   Advanced Analytics and Reporting: Dashboards showing reference distribution by technology, client, year, etc.
   Workflow/Approval Process: A formal workflow for submitting and approving new references before they become widely visible.
   Integration with other internal systems: (e.g., CRM, HR system for responsible person lookup).
   Public-facing Portal: A curated view of selected references for the company website.
   Versioning of References: Tracking changes to reference details over time.
   Multi-language support for reference content.
