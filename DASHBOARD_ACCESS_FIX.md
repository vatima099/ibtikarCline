# üîß Dashboard Access Issue - Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem

After deploying to Vercel, users cannot access the dashboard (`/dashboard`) even though it works locally. This is because NextAuth.js requires the correct `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable to function properly in production.

## Root Cause

The dashboard page uses `getServerSideProps` with session authentication, which requires NextAuth to be properly configured with the production URL.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to your Vercel project dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
2. Add/Update these variables:

```
MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://vatimahamdy:7Yatbadi@cluster0.y5xbwdp.mongodb.net/reference-management
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = my-super-secret-nextauth-key-for-jwt-signing-2024
NEXTAUTH_URL = https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Replace `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel deployment URL.

### 2. Alternative Method: Using Vercel Secrets

If you prefer using Vercel secrets (recommended for production):

```bash
# Set secrets via Vercel CLI
vercel secrets add mongodb-uri "mongodb+srv://vatimahamdy:7Yatbadi@cluster0.y5xbwdp.mongodb.net/reference-management"
vercel secrets add nextauth-secret "my-super-secret-nextauth-key-for-jwt-signing-2024"
vercel secrets add nextauth-url "https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app"
```

### 3. Redeploy

After setting the environment variables:

1. Trigger a new deployment (push to git or manually redeploy)
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Test dashboard access

## How to Find Your Vercel URL

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Look for the "Domains" section
4. Copy the `.vercel.app` URL (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Homepage**: Visit your deployed site root URL
2. **Sign In**: Go to `/auth/signin` and log in
3. **Dashboard**: After login, you should be redirected to `/dashboard`
4. **Manual Access**: Try accessing `/dashboard` directly while logged in

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still redirected to signin after login

**Solution**: Clear browser cache and cookies, then try again.

### Issue: Database connection errors

**Solution**: Verify `MONGODB_URI` is correctly set in Vercel environment variables.

### Issue: Authentication errors

**Solution**: Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` matches exactly (no extra spaces).

### Issue: Redirect loops

**Solution**: Double-check `NEXTAUTH_URL` is the exact production URL.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` set to production URL (not localhost)
- [ ] `MONGODB_URI` correctly configured
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` matches local environment
- [ ] New deployment triggered after env var changes
- [ ] Can access login page (`/auth/signin`)
- [ ] Can successfully log in
- [ ] Dashboard loads after login (`/dashboard`)

## Additional Notes

- The `vercel.json` file has been updated to include `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- Local development still uses `.env.local` with `localhost:3000`
- Production uses Vercel environment variables
- Session strategy is JWT-based, no additional session store needed

## Still Having Issues?

1. Check Vercel function logs for any errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure no typos in the production URL
4. Try logging in with a fresh browser session
