# Automatic Deployment Setup Guide

## Overview

Your project is now configured for automatic deployment to Vercel whenever you push commits to the `master` branch. This setup includes both Vercel's native Git integration and a GitHub Actions workflow for additional reliability.

## What's Been Configured

### 1. Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)

- **Git Integration**: Enabled automatic deployment for the `master` branch
- **GitHub Integration**: Enabled with auto-alias and visible deployment notifications
- **Environment Variables**: Pre-configured for your MongoDB and NextAuth setup
- **Function Timeout**: Set to 30 seconds for API routes
- **Region**: Optimized for `iad1` (US East)

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

- **Trigger**: Runs on every push and pull request to `master`
- **Steps**:
  - Code checkout
  - Node.js 18 setup with npm caching
  - Dependency installation
  - Linting check
  - Build verification
  - Vercel deployment

## Required GitHub Secrets

To use the GitHub Actions workflow, you need to add these secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/vatima099/ibtikarCline`
2. Click on **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Add the following secrets:

### Required Secrets:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel personal access token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID

### How to Get These Values:

#### VERCEL_TOKEN:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
2. Create a new token with appropriate scope
3. Copy the token value

#### VERCEL_ORG_ID and VERCEL_PROJECT_ID:

1. Run `npx vercel link` in your project directory
2. The values will be saved in `.vercel/project.json`
3. Or find them in your Vercel project settings

## Current Deployment Status

Based on your Vercel dashboard:

- ✅ Project: `ibtikar-cline`
- ✅ Domain: `ibtikar-cline.vercel.app`
- ✅ Branch: `master` (currently deployed)
- ✅ Framework: Next.js
- ✅ Auto-deployment: **ENABLED**

## How It Works

### Automatic Deployment Flow:

1. **Push to Master**: When you push commits to the `master` branch
2. **Vercel Native**: Vercel automatically detects the push and starts deployment
3. **GitHub Actions**: Simultaneously runs build verification and backup deployment
4. **Live Update**: Your changes are live at `ibtikar-cline.vercel.app`

### Deployment Verification:

- ✅ Linting passes
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Tests pass (if any)
- ✅ Deployment completes

## Testing the Setup

To test automatic deployment:

```bash
# 1. Make a small change (e.g., update README.md)
echo "# Test Auto-Deploy" >> README.md

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify automatic deployment"
git push origin master

# 3. Watch deployment progress:
# - Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/vatima099/ibtikarCline/actions
# - Check Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
# - Verify live site: https://ibtikar-cline.vercel.app
```

## Monitoring Deployments

### Vercel Dashboard:

- Real-time deployment logs
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Domain management

### GitHub Actions:

- Build status badges
- Detailed logs for each step
- Failure notifications
- Deployment history

## Environment Variables

Your environment variables are securely managed:

- **Development**: `.env.local` (not committed)
- **Production**: Vercel dashboard environment variables
- **Secrets**: Referenced as `@secret-name` in `vercel.json`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Deployment Fails**:

   - Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
   - Verify all environment variables are set
   - Ensure dependencies are properly listed in `package.json`

2. **GitHub Actions Fails**:

   - Verify GitHub secrets are correctly set
   - Check workflow logs for specific errors
   - Ensure Vercel CLI has proper permissions

3. **Environment Variables Missing**:
   - Add missing variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Update `vercel.json` if needed
   - Redeploy to apply changes

## Next Steps

Your automatic deployment is now fully configured! Every commit to `master` will:

- ✅ Trigger automatic deployment
- ✅ Run quality checks
- ✅ Update your live application
- ✅ Provide deployment notifications

Just commit and push your changes to see them live automatically!
